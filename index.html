         <h2>Buy It Back Black</h2>
         <p>Buy it Back Black is a group that raises money through small individual donations. We then gift that money to black owned businesses in the tri state area (Philadelphia, Delaware, and South Jersey). Since June 2020 we have raised over $25,000 and have gifted that money to over 10 black owned businesses in the city of Philadelphia and surrounding areas. We have been featured on local news, radio, and podcasts. Our Facebook group has over 20,000 members and I could not be more excited about the positive impact we have made in our communities.</p>
         <h3>How We Got Started</h3>
         <p>It started with a Facebook post…. (sound familiar?). My best friend made a post asking her followers would they be interested in pooling our money together to help businesses that were vandalized during the uprising in Philadelphia. The uprising was in response to the tragic murder of George Floyd Memorial Day weekend 2020. During this uprising and mostly peaceful protest, some people decided to loot and vandalize businesses. We knew small, black owned businesses may need extra help to get back on track. Well, the feedback from the Facebook post was positive so my best friend asked me as well as a former classmate of ours to get this up and running! So, we started a Facebook group, partnered with a black owned crowd funding platform, and raised $10,000 in less than a month! Most donations were less than $50. We had support from so many people. This was truly a community gift! Money raised by the community to uplift the community. </p>
         <h3>Our Donors</h3>
         <p>My role in our philanthropic effort is Director of Quality Assurance and Donor Engagement. Our donors are truly partners and give more than just money to support this effort. They share our posts on their social media and invite friends and family to join the cause. They also, during some campaigns, vote for who will receive the gift. Our donor partners are diverse in every way, race, career, and the reason they choose to support our mission! </p>
         <h3>How it works</h3>
         <p>We have had a total of 3 campaigns. The first step is to raise money. We post updates and links in the FB group, our Instagram page, our personal social media, and we also communicate with our donors directly via email. We also network with city leaders, influencers, and other businesses to encourage them to donate. Each campaign has a different awardee structure determined by what the current need is. The winners of the community gift must send us updates on what they’ve done with the monetary gift and give back to the fund for twelve consecutive campaigns with a minimum $20 donation. That’s it!! After winners are awarded, we start over again. </p>
         <h3>What's Next</h3>
         <p>We are currently accepting donations for our 4th round! We call this our first “Dream Project”. The 3 of us have chosen a black owned brand called FoodChasers to receive money raised in just 10 days. The owners are former Philadelphia school district educators who have always dreamed of owning their own restaurant. They have consistently supported small restaurants, food trucks, and caterers. They are raising money on their own, but we hope to make a large donation from our group. Our ultimate goal is to replicate our process in other cities nationwide. We are also planning to expand our services to more than just offering a monetary gift. We hope to help these businesses sustain by providing mentorships, resources, and networking opportunities. </p>
         <h3>Where Does Coding Tie In</h3>
         <p>Our Facebook group has over 20,000 members and is growing. It has become a community of business owners and people who want to search for and patronize black owned businesses in our area. Our members are extremely active, and it has become challenging to communicate effectively with our donors via Facebook. We need a website or an app to streamline and organize information and details about new campaigns. I’m excited to use the skills I’ll learn in LaunchCode to create this important tool that will help grow and expand our mission. The idea that I will be able to create this will resonate deeply with my partners as well as the entire Buy It Back Black community. </p>
